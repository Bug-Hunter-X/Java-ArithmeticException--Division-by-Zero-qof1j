# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero. The `BuggyDivision.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `FixedDivision.java` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**
The original code attempts to divide an integer by zero, which is undefined in mathematics and results in an `ArithmeticException` at runtime.

**Solution:**
The corrected code includes a check to prevent division by zero.  This is a simple yet effective solution to avoid runtime exceptions.
